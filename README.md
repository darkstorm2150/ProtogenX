# Protogen X

Protogen X is a cutting-edge text-to-image generation tool powered by the stable diffusion methodology. Breaking away from traditional Python implementations, Protogen X delivers a robust C++ solution that directly handles `.tensor` model files for optimal performance and streamlined processing.

# StableDiffusionText2Image Development Plan

## Phase 1: Model Loading & GPU Setup
- Implement the model loader for ".safetensors".
- Set up GPU configurations to ensure the model runs on GPU.
- Test this phase by simply loading the model and initializing it on the GPU.

## Phase 2: Text Processing & Interface
- Implement the text input mechanism via CLI.
- Preprocess the text input if necessary (tokenization, normalization, etc.).
- Create a basic CLI interface.
  Example CLI command: text2img_cli --model_path "path/to/Protogen_V2.2-pruned-fp16.safetensors" --input_text "Your text here" --output_path "path/to/generated.jpg"

## Phase 3: Text-to-Image Generation
- Implement the stable diffusion method for text-to-image synthesis using the loaded model.
- Ensure the model uses the processed text as input and outputs an image.
- Save the generated image to the specified output path.

## Phase 4: Feedback & Error Handling
- Provide real-time feedback.
- Implement error handling mechanisms: model loading failures, GPU issues, invalid inputs, etc.

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
- Test the complete flow with various text inputs.
- Optimize the performance, especially the GPU processing parts.

## Phase 6: Documentation & Examples
- Update the README.md with a project description, setup guide, usage guide, and additional information.
- Provide sample outputs in the repository or link to an external gallery.

## Phase 7: Community Engagement & Feedback
- Open issues for known bugs or improvements.
- Encourage user feedback and contributions.
- Address GitHub issues and pull requests regularly.

## Phase 8: Continuous Integration & Releases
- Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Release new versions with updates, improvements, and bug fixes.
